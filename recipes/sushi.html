            Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. This is a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to learn how to make a perfect roll, but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi (Japanese horseradish) for a good kick!

        <h3 class="ing">Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="ingrecipe">
        <ul>
           <li>2 cups Japanese sushi rice</li> 
           <li>6 tablespoons rice wine vinegar</li>
          <li>6 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
           <li> 2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
           <li>8 ounces smoked salmon, cut into long strips</li>
            <li>cucumber, peeled and sliced</li>
           <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and sliced</li>

            <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later. </li>
            <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
            <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed. </li>
            <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls. </li>
